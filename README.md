# 📦 Olist Supply Chain Analytics: E-commerce Logistics Optimization
> **An End-to-End Data Engineering and Business Intelligence Project**

## 📌 Project Overview
In the highly competitive e-commerce sector, last-mile delivery and supply chain efficiency are the primary drivers of customer retention. Late deliveries directly correlate with negative reviews, increased return rates, and revenue loss.

This project analyzes a real-world, highly relational database of ~100k orders from **Olist**, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. By processing 9 interconnected datasets (orders, customers, payments, reviews, and geolocation), this project builds a robust **Star Schema** data model to uncover logistical bottlenecks.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- **Data Engineering:** Perform ETL processes on multiple raw CSV files to handle missing values, standardize timestamps, and build a relational model.
- **Logistics Performance:** Measure the "On-Time Delivery Rate" and calculate the average delay (in days) using advanced DAX Time Intelligence.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Identify the specific Brazilian states and freight routes that cause the most severe logistical bottlenecks.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Correlate delivery delays with customer review scores to quantify the business impact of logistical failures.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Data Transformation (ETL):** SQL / Power Query
* **Data Modeling:** Power BI (Star Schema / Dimensional Modeling)
* **Analytics:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
